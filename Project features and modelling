FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM:
Facial recognition technology is being  increasingly used for transactions and  OTP veriﬁcation, but it poses a  challenge to security and convenience.
​The Secure-Face project aims to develop a comprehensive face detectionand recognition system that strikes a balance between security, 
  user convenience, privacy, and technology accuracy and reliability.
​The system will provide robust facial recognition capabilities while addressing the concerns of users regarding data privacy and ease of use.
Facial recognition is a technology that uses  algorithms to identify and verify a person's  identity based on their facial features. 
It  can be used for authentication,  identiﬁcation and surveillance. However, it  has limitations and risks such as false  positives and privacy concerns.
BENEFITS OF FACIAL RECOGNITION:
Facial recognition can provide a secure and convenient way to verify transactions and OTPs.  
It can reduce the risk of fraud and identity theft. It  can also improve customer experience by  eliminating the need for passwords and physical  tokens.​
* A benefit of facial recognition in retail is that it could make the shopping experience faster and more convenient.​
* Despite many security measures taken by financial institutions worldwide, banking fraud is still a recurring problem. 
Face recognition online banking could help solve it.

The components that a facial recognition system typically includes:
Data Collection and Preparation: In this step, we collect data for the faces that we want to recognize. 
                                This data can be collected through various sources like pictures, videos, etc. 
                                Once the data is collected, we preprocess it to ensure that the data is uniform in size and format.

Training Model: The training model is responsible for recognizing faces from the collected data. 
                This model is built using machine learning algorithms like neural networks, support vector machines, etc. 
                The training model is trained on the collected data and optimized to minimize errors.

Face Detection: Face detection is a critical step in facial recognition. 
                It involves locating and extracting the face from an image.
                This is done using techniques like Haar Cascades, which is a machine learning-based object detection algorithm.

Face Recognition: In this step, the trained model is used to recognize the face that has been detected. 
                  This is done by comparing the detected face with the faces in the training data. 
                  The closest match is considered to be the recognized face.

Authentication: Once the face is recognized, the system can authenticate the user based on the information associated with that face. 
                For example, if the user has provided an OTP along with the facial recognition, the system can verify if the OTP is valid for that user.
                
                
To ensure security and user privacy, the facial recognition system should also include the following components:
Data Encryption: All data collected and stored by the system should be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
User Consent: Users should be informed about the data collection and the purpose of using their facial data. 
              Users should also have the option to opt-out if they do not wish to share their facial data.
Fraud Detection: The system should have mechanisms in place to detect and prevent fraud or spoofing. 
                  For example, it can detect if a user is using a picture of someone else's face instead of their own.
System Auditing: The system should keep a record of all transactions and activities for auditing purposes. 
                  This can help in detecting any fraudulent activities or errors in the system.
